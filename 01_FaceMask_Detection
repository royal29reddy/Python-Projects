This Python project utilizes OpenCV to perform real-time face and mouth detection using both image files and webcam video feed. 
The project has two main functionalities:
1) Face Detection in an Image:
The project loads an image, converts it to grayscale, and detects faces using a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier (nose.xml).
Once faces are detected, it draws a green rectangle around them and displays the image in a window. It also saves the processed image with detected faces.

2) Real-time Mouth Detection via Webcam:
The project uses the webcam feed to detect the mouth in real-time.
It continuously captures video frames, resizes them for performance, converts them to grayscale, and detects the mouth using the detectMultiScale() method.
When a mouth is detected, a green rectangle is drawn around it, and the frame is displayed in a window. The program continues until the "Esc" key is pressed.

Working:
Image-based Face Detection:
The image is loaded and converted to grayscale.
The face is detected using a Haar cascade classifier.
A rectangle is drawn around each detected face, and the image is displayed and saved with the marked faces.

Real-time Webcam Mouth Detection:
The webcam captures frames continuously.
Each frame is resized and converted to grayscale.
The mouth is detected using the cascade classifier, and a rectangle is drawn around the detected mouth.
The frame with detected mouths is displayed in real-time until the user presses the "Esc" key to exit.


Instructions:
Folder Setup: Before running the project, ensure you have an images folder in your project directory. Place your test image (like face2.jpg) inside the images folder for face detection to work correctly.
Dependencies: Make sure you have OpenCV installed by running pip install opencv-python.
